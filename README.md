# Blood Bank Management System

Objectives of the Blood Bank Management System are as follows:
* To register a person as a donor or a patient.
* To let the patients search for the donors and make their request for the blood or plasma as per their requirement.
* To help by providing a medium for the donors to donate blood or plasma.
* To make people aware about the criteria a donor must meet in order to donate blood or plasma.
* To provide a means for the volunteers above or equal to 18 years of age to organize blood donation camps or plasma donation camps.

To sum up, the main purpose of the blood bank management system is to simplify the process of searching for blood or plasma in case of any emergency and maintain the records of donors, patients, blood or plasma donation camps and blood/plasma stocks in the bank.
